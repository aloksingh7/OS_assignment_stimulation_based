Write a program for multilevel queue scheduling algorithm. There must be three
queues generated. There must be specific range of priority associated with every queue. Now,
prompt the user to enter number of processes along with their priority and burst time. Each
process must occupy the respective queue with specific priority range according to its priority.
Apply Round robin algorithm with quantum time 4 on queue with highest priority range. Apply
priority scheduling algorithm on the queue with medium range of priority and First come first
serve algorithm on the queue with lowest range of priority. Each and every queue should get a
quantum time of 10 seconds. Cpu will keep on shifting between queues after every 10 seconds
i.e. to apply round robin algorithm OF 10 seconds on over all structure.
Calculate Waiting time and turnaround time for every process. The input for number of
processes should be given by the user.
